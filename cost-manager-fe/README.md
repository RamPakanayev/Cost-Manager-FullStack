# Running the server
to run the server firstly connect to your server and cd to Cost-Manager-Frontend folder:
`cd Cost-Manager-Frontend/cost-manager-fe/`

then if the server is not running start the server with pm2:
`sudo pm2 --name CostManagerFE start npm -- run "server-start"`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `sudo pm2 --name CostManagerFE start npm -- run "server-start"`

Runs the app in the production mode, and server the npm run server-start command in the background

### `sudo pm2 logs`

show the logs for pm2 processes

### `sudo pm2 ps`

show the currently running pm2 processes

### `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :80`

shows proccess id that listens on port 80, to kill the proccess run `kill -9 <proccess_id>`

### `sudo pm2 delete <process_id>`

for example  `sudo pm2 delete 0`

### `npm run server-start`

Runs the app in the production mode using the serve package
the serve package needs a build that can be produced by `npm run build`
afterwards we can run the serve command using
- `serve -s build` 
- `sudo serve -p 80 -s build` with specific port 

to install the serve package run `sudo npm install -g serve`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
